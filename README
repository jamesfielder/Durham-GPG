This is going to be so awesome!

To do:

- Need a small beamer presentation to do it with. Keep it really minimal though.
- Finish the Linux guide, should be easy.
- Pad out the rest of the guides with more text, there is still space left and stuff to say in it.
- Don't destroy the world.
- I just went passed a sign that said "AWS" but in huge letters.
