Thanks to John Chapman again for this donation.

To produce the presentation:

- Build with Latex (twice because bibtex was used)
- convert to .ps (dvips)
- convert .ps to .pdf (ps2pdf)

Because of the graphics pdflatex does not give good results.
Converting dvi to pdf directly didn't work correctly for me either.
